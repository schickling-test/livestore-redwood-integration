# SSR PoC Integration Findings

## Executive Summary

After deep investigation into integrating LiveStore with RedwoodJS SDK's SSR capabilities, I've identified fundamental architectural incompatibilities that make a direct SSR integration challenging. However, I've designed a hybrid approach that could enable SSR with LiveStore.

## Key Findings

### 1. RedwoodJS SDK Setup Requirements

The RedwoodJS SDK requires specific configuration:
- Must use `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` alongside `rwsdk/vite`
- Requires proper wrangler.toml configuration
- Uses Miniflare to emulate Cloudflare Workers locally

### 2. LiveStore's Browser-Only Dependencies

LiveStore fundamentally depends on browser-only APIs:
- **Web Workers**: Required for SQLite WASM execution
- **SharedWorker**: Used for cross-tab synchronization
- **OPFS (Origin Private File System)**: For persistent storage
- **SQLite WASM**: Requires Worker context for execution

These APIs are not available in any server environment, including:
- Node.js
- Cloudflare Workers
- Edge runtimes

### 3. Hybrid SSR Approach

I've implemented a hybrid approach that enables SSR while maintaining LiveStore functionality:

```typescript
// ServerLiveStoreProvider.tsx
export function ServerLiveStoreProvider({ children }: Props) {
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)
  const [adapter, setAdapter] = useState<any>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true)
    // Dynamic imports to avoid SSR issues
    const initializeAdapter = async () => {
      const { default: LiveStoreWorker } = await import('../livestore.worker?worker')
      const { default: LiveStoreSharedWorker } = await import('@livestore/adapter-web/shared-worker?sharedworker')
      
      const adapter = makePersistedAdapter({
        storage: { type: 'opfs' },
        worker: LiveStoreWorker,
        sharedWorker: LiveStoreSharedWorker,
      })
      
      setAdapter(adapter)
    }
    initializeAdapter()
  }, [])

  // Server-side rendering
  if (!isClient) {
    return <div>{children}</div>
  }

  // Client-side with adapter ready
  return (
    <LiveStoreProvider schema={schema} adapter={adapter} storeId="todomvc">
      {children}
    </LiveStoreProvider>
  )
}
```

### 4. Technical Blockers for Full SSR

1. **Worker Environment Mismatch**
   - Cloudflare Workers â‰  Web Workers
   - No SharedWorker API in server environments
   - No OPFS access server-side

2. **SQLite WASM Architecture**
   - Requires specific Worker thread features
   - Memory management tied to browser APIs
   - Cannot run in V8 isolates without browser context

3. **Event Sourcing State**
   - LiveStore's event sourcing requires persistent state
   - Server-side would need completely different storage backend
   - State synchronization between server/client would be complex

## Recommendations for PoC

### Option 1: Hybrid SSR (Recommended)
- Server renders UI shell and static content
- LiveStore initializes on client after hydration
- Progressive enhancement approach
- **Pros**: Maintains SSR benefits, full LiveStore functionality
- **Cons**: No server-side data, initial render shows loading state

### Option 2: Server-Side Adapter
- Create a server-compatible LiveStore adapter
- Use different storage backend (e.g., Cloudflare D1)
- Sync state between server and client
- **Pros**: Full SSR with data
- **Cons**: Major engineering effort, complex state synchronization

### Option 3: Static Pre-rendering
- Pre-render common states at build time
- Hydrate with LiveStore on client
- **Pros**: Better initial render than pure client-side
- **Cons**: Limited to static data scenarios

## Implementation Status

I've implemented the hybrid SSR approach with:
- `ServerLiveStoreProvider`: Handles SSR gracefully
- `TodoAppSSR`: Component that renders shell on server
- Dynamic imports to avoid SSR build issues
- Proper error boundaries and loading states

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Fix RedwoodJS SDK Development Server**
   - Currently experiencing issues with the dev server not responding
   - May need additional configuration or debugging

2. **Test Hybrid Approach**
   - Verify SSR shell renders correctly
   - Ensure smooth client-side hydration
   - Test cross-tab synchronization still works

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure initial render improvements
   - Check hydration performance
   - Verify no regressions in LiveStore functionality

4. **Consider Server Adapter (Future)**
   - Design API-compatible server adapter
   - Use Cloudflare D1 for server-side storage
   - Implement state synchronization protocol

## Conclusion

While full SSR with LiveStore's current architecture is not feasible due to browser-only dependencies, the hybrid approach provides a practical path forward. This allows applications to benefit from SSR's initial render performance while maintaining LiveStore's powerful client-side capabilities.

The key insight is that LiveStore's architecture is fundamentally client-centric, and any SSR integration must respect these constraints while finding creative ways to provide server-side rendering benefits.
