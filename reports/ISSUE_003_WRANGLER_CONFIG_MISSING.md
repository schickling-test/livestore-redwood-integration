# Issue #003: RedwoodJS SDK Requires Wrangler Configuration

## Problem Description

The RedwoodJS SDK Vite plugin expects a Wrangler configuration file with a `main` field pointing to the worker entry point.

## Error Message

```
Error: The provided Wrangler config main field (/home/schickling/code/playground/2025/jul/livestore-redwood/dist/worker.js) doesn't point to an existing file
```

## Investigation

The RedwoodJS SDK is built on top of Cloudflare's Vite plugin, which requires:
1. A wrangler.toml configuration file
2. The main field pointing to the built worker file

## Solution

Create a wrangler.toml file with proper configuration for the RedwoodJS SDK worker.
