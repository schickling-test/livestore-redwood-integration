# Final Report: LiveStore + RedwoodJS SDK Integration Challenges

## Summary

Attempted to integrate LiveStore TodoMVC example with RedwoodJS SDK. While both are powerful frameworks, their architectural differences create significant integration challenges.

## Key Challenges Encountered

### 1. Fundamental Architecture Mismatch

**LiveStore**:
- Client-first architecture
- Runs entirely in the browser
- Uses Web Workers and SharedWorkers for SQLite WASM
- No server requirements for core functionality
- Event sourcing with local materializers

**RedwoodJS SDK**:
- Server-first architecture
- Built for Cloudflare Workers edge runtime
- Focuses on SSR and React Server Components
- Expects server-side route handling
- Designed for server-rendered applications

### 2. Technical Issues

#### 2.1 Vite Plugin Import
- RedwoodJS SDK exports named `redwood` plugin, not default
- Fixed by changing import to `import { redwood } from 'rwsdk/vite'`

#### 2.2 Worker Configuration
- Requires wrangler.toml configuration
- Expects worker entry point
- Node.js compatibility warnings for `async_hooks`

#### 2.3 Server Not Accessible
- Dev server reports running on https://localhost:3000/
- Cannot access via curl or browser
- Possible issues:
  - HTTPS certificate problems
  - Worker not properly handling requests
  - Middleware intercepting requests

### 3. Attempted Solutions

1. **Static HTML Approach**: Created minimal worker serving static HTML - didn't work
2. **SSR Integration**: Tried using RedwoodJS SDK's render system - server became inaccessible
3. **Client-Only Mode**: No documentation or clear path for client-only apps in RedwoodJS SDK

### 4. Root Cause Analysis

The core issue is that RedwoodJS SDK is designed as a full-stack framework for server-rendered applications on Cloudflare Workers. It's not designed for client-only SPAs. Key indicators:

1. All examples use server-side rendering
2. Router expects React components to be rendered on server
3. No clear documentation for static/client-only mode
4. Framework philosophy is "server-first by default"

### 5. LiveStore-Specific Challenges

LiveStore requires:
- HTTPS for SharedWorker support
- Client-side execution environment
- No server-side rendering of database operations
- Web Worker for SQLite WASM

These requirements conflict with RedwoodJS SDK's server-first approach.

### 6. Recommendations

#### For This Specific Use Case
1. **Use Plain Vite**: LiveStore works perfectly with standard Vite setup
2. **Alternative Frameworks**: Consider frameworks designed for client-side apps (Next.js static export, Remix SPA mode)
3. **Cloudflare Pages**: Deploy the Vite build to Cloudflare Pages instead of Workers

#### For Future Integration
1. **Wait for Documentation**: RedwoodJS SDK might add client-only support in future
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Use RedwoodJS SDK for API/backend, separate client app for LiveStore
3. **Custom Worker**: Write a custom Cloudflare Worker that serves the client app without RedwoodJS SDK

### 7. Conclusion

While both LiveStore and RedwoodJS SDK are excellent technologies, they're designed for different use cases:

- **LiveStore**: Perfect for client-first, local-first applications with optional sync
- **RedwoodJS SDK**: Ideal for server-rendered applications on Cloudflare's edge

The integration attempted here goes against the grain of both frameworks. A successful integration would require either:
1. LiveStore to support server-side execution (unlikely given SQLite WASM requirements)
2. RedwoodJS SDK to better support client-only applications (not its primary focus)

**Recommendation**: Use LiveStore with standard Vite for the best developer experience and deploy to static hosting or Cloudflare Pages.
